### Get device location

Getting the current location or device location has achieved via the `geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method, which is a JavaScript built-in web API call that is used to get the current position of a device and represent that position in the form of latitude and longitude. After getting the coordinates of the current location, we can use them with a weather API to get our current location's weather data. In this app, OpenWeatherMap API has been used!
